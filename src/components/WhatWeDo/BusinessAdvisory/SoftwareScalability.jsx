                text panel `sm:w-[65%] lg:w-[59.5%]` and the image `sm:w-[40.5%]` with no lg
                override, so between sm and lg (65 + 40.5 = 105.5%) the two panels actually
                overlapped by 5.5% — and below sm, both were `w-full inset-y-0`, so on mobile
                the opaque white text panel sat directly on top of the image and hid it
                completely. A flex row can't overlap its children by construction, and `flex-1`
                on the image lets it fill whatever width the text column doesn't use at any
                size, so there's nothing left to keep manually in sync across breakpoints. */}
