// Rebuilt against Figma node 2662:159 — the previous version had a different
// header (left-aligned, "Why Enterprise Partner With Us"), a single reused
// icon repeated 4x, and 3 of the 4 cards' copy was invented to fill in for a
// skeleton-repeat pattern. None of that matches this node: real header copy,
// 4 distinct icons, and every card has its own genuine text. Row-major order
// here ([Certified, Predictable, EndToEnd, LongRun]) is deliberate — with
// grid-cols-2's default row-major flow, that ordering is what lands
// Certified/EndToEnd in the left column and Predictable/LongRun in the right
// column, matching Figma's left/right grouping without needing separate
// per-column arrays.
// Split into two independent columns instead of one array mapped over a
// shared grid — Figma stacks Certified/EndToEnd on the left and
// Predictable/LongRun on the right as two separately-flowing lists (the
// left column's first item sits ~87px lower than the right column's), which
// a single `grid-cols-2` can never reproduce: grid auto-placement forces
// both columns into the same row tracks, so neither the top offset nor the
// two horizontal dividers can move independently of each other.

            {/* Desktop: two independently-flowing columns. The vertical divider is
                its own thin flex item between them (not a border on the columns
                themselves), so `items-stretch` sizes it to exactly this row's own
                content height — never the full section — and it never touches the
                horizontal dividers, which stop at each column's own width instead
                of spanning into the shared gap. The left column's extra top
                padding (pt-12) is what creates the ~87px stagger against the right
                column's first item, matching Figma — every other spacing value
                (icon/heading/description gaps, divider-to-item gap) stays identical
                between the two columns.

                Divider colors are the real values pulled from Figma's own line
                assets (imgLine70 → #A4A7A5 horizontal, imgLine84 → #8794A3
                vertical, the latter matching the --Border-strong token), each at
                reduced opacity — a solid 1px line at full strength reads bolder on
                screen than it does in the Figma canvas. Same /opacity treatment
                the project already uses elsewhere for subtle dividers (see
                Ascendus/WhyUs.jsx's divide-[#4a5568]/30) rather than inventing an
                unrelated lighter hex. */}
