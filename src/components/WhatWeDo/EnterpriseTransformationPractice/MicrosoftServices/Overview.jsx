                    Most enterprises we work with run Microsoft and SAP side by side already, Microsoft handling
                    productivity, subsidiary operations, or reporting that doesn&apos;t need full SAP weight behind
                    it. Microsoft Services covers the cloud, collaboration, low-code, CRM, and analytics work on
                    that side of the landscape, designed to connect cleanly to the SAP core rather than duplicate it.
