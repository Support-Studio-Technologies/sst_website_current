                    The SAP core rarely causes a transformation to stall. What surrounds it does: systems that
                    don&apos;t talk to each other, data no one trusts, users who quietly revert to their old
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We treat that surrounding work as core to delivery, not an afterthought bolted onto the SAP
                    project plan after the budget for it has already been spent elsewhere.
