                At the Figma reference frame (1280px viewport → 1152px content) each card is
                256px and the gap between them is 42.67px — exactly 3.7% of the row's own content
                width. Cards stay fluid (flex-1) so they grow together with the viewport instead of
                staying pinned at 256px while empty gap soaks up the rest of the width; the gap is
                a % of the row itself (not vw, which over-counts the section's own 64px padding)
                and is capped at that literal 42.67px Figma value so it never grows past what the
                design actually shows and starves the cards of width on larger monitors.
 
                Height is driven by aspect-ratio, not a fixed px, and locked to Figma's own
                256:320 (open) / 256:240 (closed) ratios — 4:5 and 16:15. Pinning height in px
                while width was fluid (flex-1) let the card's box get proportionally wider than
                Figma's own ratio at most viewport sizes, so object-cover had to crop more off the
                top/bottom of the photo than Figma shows. Locking the ratio means the box's shape
                — and therefore how much of the photo is visible — stays identical to Figma at
                any card width. min-h-[280px] is a floor under that ratio so the open card's title
                + description never run out of vertical room on narrower desktop widths, where a
                pure aspect-ratio height would otherwise get too short for the copy to fit. */}
