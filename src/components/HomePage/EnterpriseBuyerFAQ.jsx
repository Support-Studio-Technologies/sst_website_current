// Figma's "Can you help with regional compliance requi—" cuts off mid-word with
// no fuller version elsewhere in the file; completed here to match the GCC
// compliance language already used in WhyEnterprisePartnerWithUs on this page.
// Figma also carried a stray duplicate row (a truncated repeat of the SAP
// landscape question) — dropped here, keeping only the complete version.
const QUESTIONS = [
    {
        q: "How long does a typical SAP implementation take?",
        a: "Timelines vary by scope, but most full implementations run 4 to 9 months. Phased rollouts and platform migrations can move faster once the initial landscape is assessed.",
    },
    {
        q: "Do you only work with new SAP builds, or can you take over an existing landscape?",
        a: "Both. We take on new builds, and we regularly step into existing SAP landscapes mid-engagement, whether that means stabilizing what's there or continuing a transformation someone else started.",
    },
    {
        q: "Can you help with regional compliance requirements like e-invoicing and data residency?",
        a: "Yes. We work inside the regulatory realities of the GCC, from e-invoicing mandates to data residency requirements, so compliance is built into the landscape rather than bolted on afterward.",
    },
    {
        q: "Do you replace our internal IT team, or work alongside them?",
        a: "We work alongside your team. Most engagements pair our specialists with your internal staff, transferring knowledge as we go rather than creating a dependency on us.",
    },
    {
        q: "Can you work with our existing technology and systems?",
        a: "Yes. We design around what you already have, integrating with existing ERP, cloud, and business systems rather than asking you to rip and replace what already works.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do you measure the success of an engagement?",
        a: "Against the outcomes we agree on upfront, uptime, adoption, process efficiency, or cost, not just go-live dates. We review progress against those metrics throughout the engagement, not just at the end.",
    },
