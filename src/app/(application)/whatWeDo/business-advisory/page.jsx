                The reveal distance below is sized to WhyBusinessAdvisoryMatters' own content
                height (not a full 100vh like the cybersecurity page's longer curtain section),
                so min-height doesn't force a big empty gap under it. That min-height on the
                curtain still has to stay >= the reveal distance, though — the sticky hero keeps
                unpinning (scrolling away) for the entire reveal distance, so if the curtain's
                own height came in shorter than that, it would finish scrolling past first and
                the hero would peek through in the leftover gap before the next section. */}
